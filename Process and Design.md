# Process & Design # 

### Who is the site for? ###

Understand the audience your site may attract and what information they will expect to find on it. Every website should be designed for the target audience- not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

After knowing who are visitor our site. Ask ourselves why are they coming. Most people will visit for a very specific reason.
* Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
* If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional one? 
* Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxyry?

Now that we know who is coming to our site and why they are coming, work out on what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

### Get your message across using design ###

Organize information so that visitors can find what they are looking for. The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

**CONTENT**

Web pages often have a lot of information to communicate. For example, the pages of online newspapers will have information that does not appear on every page. With so much on the page, the designer needs to **organize** and **prioritize** the information to communicate their message and help users find what theyâ€™re looking for.

* **PRIORITIZING**
If everything on a page appeared in the same style, it would be much harder to understand. By making parts of the page look **distinct** from surrounding content, designers draw attention to those items. 

* **ORGANIZING**
**Grouping** together related content into **blocks** or **chunks** makes the page look simpler and easier to understand. User should be able to identify the purpose of each block without processing each individual item. By presenting certain types of information in a s**similar** visual style. Users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content. 

### Designing Navigation ##

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles.

* CONCISE       
* CLEAR
* SELECTIVE
* CONTEXT
* INTERACTIVE
* CONSISTENT
