## Growth Mindset ##

  Imagine the feeling of failure. The part of the long road to success but only if we think about it in a growth mindset way. However, dwelling on failure or lack of success can lead to resentment, hopelessness and shame. Embracing fixed mindset cannot help us grow or transform. We have to defy the odds, overcome our mind and thrives off growth mindset. 



### *Growth Mindset* vs *Fixed Mindset*

  In *Growth Mindset* there two types we can cultivate. One that view problems as opportunity to improve certain skill and learn from it, and one that avoids it at all cost out of fear of failure. People that avoids problem or conflicts can be described as possessing a *fixed mindset*. Those who look at problems and gain interest from facing challenges have a *growth mindset*. Occasionally we like to switch from one another depends on which on is substantial.

  *Fixed mindset* assumes that basic traits like intelligence and talents are fixed qualities are the sole reason for success. They don't look past the challenges thinking that they don't posses the skill or talent to accomplish the task in hand and completely just avoiding it. With *growth mindset* people, they believe that they can achieve new skills and abilities by thriving through challenges and countless failure. This way of thinking creates a love for learning. Most iconic persona have this traits in common. For them life becomes more joyful journey with endless opportunity to figure out new things and advance in life.
 
**Characteristic of a Fixed Mindset**               

* Believes intelligence and talent are fixed.
* Sticks with what they know.
* Believes putting effort is worthless or fruitless.
* Believes personal failures define who they are.
* Hides flaws so not to be judged as a failure.
* Avoids challenges to avoid failure.
* Tends to give up easily.
* Ignores feedback from others.
* Views feedback as personal criticism.
* Feels threatened by the success of others.

**Characteristic of a Growth Mindset**

* Believes intelligence and talents can be developed.
* Believes effort is the path to mastery.
* Believes effort is the path to mastery.
* Believes mistakes are and essential part of learning.
* Views failure as an opportunity to learn.
* Believes failures are just temporary setbacks.
* Embraces challenges.
* Welcomes feedback from others in order to learn.
* Believes feedback is a guide to further improvement.
* Views feedback as a source of information.
* Views others success as a source of inspiration and information.

### Develop Growth Mindset
  
  -**Celebrate Trying**. The root of *growth mindset* start at home, ourselves. Cultivating this skill starts from parents, friends, teacher, co worker, boss, supervisor most important is our own mind. Anywhere we spend most of our environment. Celebrating trying encourage us to develop new skills we're interested in. Doing this will make us learn the skill which also can hep us in everyday life. Mental mindsets must be changed if we are to purse success. The ability to understand our own mindset allow us to experience the benefits that the *growth mindset* gives us. When we can shift away from our *fixed mindset* we our allowing ourself to have the ability to overcome more challenges. This mindfullness growth mindset leads to more successes and experiences.
  
  
### What is Github?

   *Github* is one of the essential tools for software engineer. Tools to help people, land a job, things that can help the world. Github lets you create elegant websites as repositories to showcase you portfolio, projects, documentation. Unlike other website there’s a lot of things needed to setup a website. Github doesn’t need database, servers to configure and anyone can use it. You don’t need to know everything about *HTML* to create website. How does it work? It create website’s tied to your name or organization using different branches. Github automatically deploy your website. You can customize, change theme, edit content throughout readme. Github lets you creat great things and share with everyone.
   
   
### What is Markdown?

  Markdown is a way to style a text on the web. When we think of Markdown we can visualize it just like cooking. It’s how you want your steak to be cooked. You can control how much serving you want,  medium, rare, of well done, how much pepper or seasoning, you can add asparagus on the side. When it comes to or in relate to markdown you can control the display of the document, serving steak, you can format the words as bold or italic,rare or well done in steak, you can also create a listing, seasoning of pepper or salt, and last important thing you can add images just like the sides on your steak dish.

### What is text editor?

   A *text editor* is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

### What features should you look for in a text editor? ###

   *Code completion* allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

   Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called *Emmet* that can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension


   *Syntax highlighting* is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

   The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice *series of themes*. These themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well.

			

Basic Navigation

*whoami* 
  * This command shows the current user who is logged in.
  
*pwd*
  * Print Working Directory-ie. Where are we currently.
  
*ls*
  * List the contents of a directory.
  
*cd*
  * Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

*Relative path*
  * A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

*Absolute path*
  * A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.


### FILES ###

*Linux is Case Sensitive*

This is very important and a common source of problems for people new to Linux. 

*Spaces in names*
Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them.

*Quotes*
The first approach involves using quotes around the entire item. You may use either single or double quotes (later on we will see that there is a subtle difference between the two but for now that difference is not a problem).

*Escape Characters*
Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.

*file*
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

*ls -a*
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

*Everything is a file under Linux Even directories.*

*Linux is an extension less system Files can have any extension they like or none at all.*

## GIT INTRO ##

### WHAT IS GITHUB? ###

### HISTORY ###

* Originally launched as Logical Awesome in 2008; launch GitHub product later 		that year. 
* Previously: no place on the web to publish and pull code from for open source 			projects 
* Had version control, but only locally

* Rapid adoption by enterprise companies between 2009-2013.  
* June 2018: Microsoft announces acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion dollars. 


### WHY GITHUB ###

Centralized Version Control - before GitHub, only git available locally on computers. Cost of centralizing git very high to companies/teams. 
Open Source - no very easy/collective place on contribute to projects/programs. No public place to display code.
Networking/Employment - no place for programmers to demonstrate code/contributions, or have code reviewed.
Code review for teams - no place to review code that was decentralized. 


### WHAT IS GIT ###

Version control software - local and on the command line 
Easy to install and maintain; very simple program to run.

### Default Text Editor ###
Without configuration of a default text editor, Git will use the system’s default editor–most likely Vim. To configure a different text editor, such as Emacs, type the following into your Terminal or Command Line:
* $ git config --global core.editor emacs


### Check Settings ###
To check settings, use the git config --list command.

### Getting Help ###
There are three ways to get more information on a particular command, by accessing the manual:
* git help command

* git command --help

* man git-command

### Setting up a Git Repository ###

### Importing ###
To import an existing project or directory into Git, follow these steps using the Terminal or Command Line:

Switch to the target project’s directoryExample:
* I $ cd test (cd = change directory)
Use the git init command$ git init Note: At this stage, you have created a new subdirectory named .git that has the repository files. Tracking has not commenced. 
To start tracking these repository files, perform an initial commit by typing the following
* I $ git add *.c
* $ git add LICENSE
* I $ git commit -m “any message here”
Cloning
You can also create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone command with a repository’s URL:
$ git clone https://github.com/test

### Workflow ###

Local Repository Structure
The local Git repository has three components
* Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
* Index: The area used for staging
* Head: Points to the most recent commit
* 
### Saving Changes ###
All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.
Tracked
Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.
Untracked
Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

### The Life Cycle of File Status ###
* After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified because of changes made after the previous commit.
* You stage the modified file.
* Then, you commit staged changes.

### Check File Status ###

To determine the state of files, utilize the git status command:
* $ git status.

### Staging files ###
From the project folder, we can use the git add command to add our files to the staging area, which allows them to be tracked.
We can add a specific file to the staging area with the following command
* git add file.js
To add multiple files, we can do this:
* git add file.js file2.js file3.js
Instead of having to add the files individually, we can also add all the files inside the project folder to the staging area:
* git add .
By default, this adds all the files and folders inside the project folder to the staging area, from where they are ready to be committed and tracked.

### Committing a File ###
After staging one or multiple files, you should commit the changes and record what you did within the commit message:
* $ git commit -m “made change x,y,z”

### Committing All Changes ###
* $ git commit -a
This command commits a snapshot of all modifications to tracked files in the working directory.

### Pushing Changes ###
Next, you would push changes to a remote repository. We will discuss remote repositories in more depth in the next section. For now, we will look at a general overview of pushing changes to remotes.
Example:
* $ git push origin master
This command pushes changes from the local “master” branch to the remote repository named “origin”.

### Stashing Changes ###
When you are not ready to commit changes but do not want to lose them either, *git stash* is a great option. This command temporarily removes changes and hides them, giving you a clean working directory. When you are ready to continue working on the changes, simply use the *of git stash apply* command to retrieve the hidden changes.

### Remote Repositories ###
In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.

### Cloned Repositories ###
As mentioned earlier, for cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.

### Seeing Your Remotes ###
By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
$ cd example

* $ git remote -v

remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)

remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)

remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)

remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push)

remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (fetch)

remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (push)
