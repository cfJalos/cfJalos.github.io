## Growth Mindset

  Imagine the feeling of failure. The part of the long road to success but only if we think about it in a growth mindset way. However, dwelling on failure or lack of success can lead to resentment, hopelessness and shame. Embracing fixed mindset cannot help us grow or transform. We have to defy the odds, overcome our mind and thrives off growth mindset. 



### *Growth Mindset* vs *Fixed Mindset*

  In *Growth Mindset* there two types we can cultivate. One that view problems as opportunity to improve certain skill and learn from it, and one that avoids it at all cost out of fear of failure. People that avoids problem or conflicts can be described as possessing a *fixed mindset*. Those who look at problems and gain interest from facing challenges have a *growth mindset*. Occasionally we like to switch from one another depends on which on is substantial.

  *Fixed mindset* assumes that basic traits like intelligence and talents are fixed qualities are the sole reason for success. They don't look past the challenges thinking that they don't posses the skill or talent to accomplish the task in hand and completely just avoiding it. With *growth mindset* people, they believe that they can achieve new skills and abilities by thriving through challenges and countless failure. This way of thinking creates a love for learning. Most iconic persona have this traits in common. For them life becomes more joyful journey with endless opportunity to figure out new things and advance in life.

This mindfullness growth mindset leads to more successes and experiences.
  
  
### What is Github?

   *Github* is one of the essential tools for software engineer. Tools to help people, land a job, things that can help the world. Github lets you create elegant websites as repositories to showcase you portfolio, projects, documentation. Unlike other website there’s a lot of things needed to setup a website. Github doesn’t need database, servers to configure and anyone can use it. You don’t need to know everything about *HTML* to create website. How does it work? It create website’s tied to your name or organization using different branches. Github automatically deploy your website. You can customize, change theme, edit content throughout readme. Github lets you creat great things and share with everyone.
   
   
### What is Markdown?

  Markdown is a way to style a text on the web. When we think of Markdown we can visualize it just like cooking. It’s how you want your steak to be cooked. You can control how much serving you want,  medium, rare, of well done, how much pepper or seasoning, you can add asparagus on the side. When it comes to or in relate to markdown you can control the display of the document, serving steak, you can format the words as bold or italic,rare or well done in steak, you can also create a listing, seasoning of pepper or salt, and last important thing you can add images just like the sides on your steak dish.

### What is text editor?

   A *text editor* is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

### What features should you look for in a text editor? ###

   *Code completion* allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

   Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called *Emmet* that can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension


   *Syntax highlighting* is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

   The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice *series of themes*. These themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well.

			

Basic Navigation

*whoami* 
  * This command shows the current user who is logged in.
  
*pwd*
	* Print Working Directory-ie. Where are we currently.
  
*ls*
	* List the contents of a directory.
  
*cd*
	* Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

*Relative path*
	* A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

*Absolute path*
	*A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.


### FILES ###

*Linux is Case Sensitive*

This is very important and a common source of problems for people new to Linux. 

*Spaces in names*
Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them.

*Quotes*
The first approach involves using quotes around the entire item. You may use either single or double quotes (later on we will see that there is a subtle difference between the two but for now that difference is not a problem).

*Escape Characters*
Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.

*file*
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

*ls -a*
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

*Everything is a file under Linux	Even directories.*

*Linux is an extension less system Files can have any extension they like or none at all.*
