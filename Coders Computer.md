### What is text editor?

   A *text editor* is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

### What features should you look for in a text editor? ###

   *Code completion* allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

   Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called *Emmet* that can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension


   *Syntax highlighting* is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

   The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice *series of themes*. These themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well.

			

Basic Navigation
| Command | 				Description 				 |
|---------|   		 		  :----:				 |
|whoami   | 	This command shows the current user who is logged in.		 |
|pwd	  |	Print Working Directory-ie. Where are we currently.		 |
|ls	  |	List the contents of a directory.				 | 
|cd	  |     Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.		 |

*Relative path*
  * A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

*Absolute path*
  * A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.


### FILES ###

*Linux is Case Sensitive*

This is very important and a common source of problems for people new to Linux. 

*Spaces in names*
Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them.

*Quotes*
The first approach involves using quotes around the entire item. You may use either single or double quotes (later on we will see that there is a subtle difference between the two but for now that difference is not a problem).

*Escape Characters*
Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.

*file*
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

*ls -a*
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

*Everything is a file under Linux Even directories.*

*Linux is an extension less system Files can have any extension they like or none at all.*
