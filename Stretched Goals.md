## STRETCH GOALS ##

### Things i learned ###

  This excercise taught me to dig deeper into GitHub markdowns. Creating table content and adding the link of each topic was challenging. I honestly did not know 
that each topic file has its own link and needed to be changed to Markdown file. I had to read most of the markdown guides and watch some YouTube videos. But, 
I didn’t find the answer I was looking for. I just give a try to change the file extension to .md which is markdown and GitHub produce this file as extension to 
readme.md.

  After learning the link of each topic file I started creating table of contents to the homepage which is the readme.md. this step was pretty easy, after all the 
guides and videos that I read and watch It pays off. I created each content with the topic linked to each content.

  At this time, all topic has it’s own page. I added a return to home page at the top which is pretty neat. Everything Is setup well. Afterwards, I started to 
check all typos missing periods and organize the page a little more. Doing this it gives me more practice to use markdown commands which I enjoyed doing. 
I’m really excited to move on to the next topic which is HTML. See you there.
